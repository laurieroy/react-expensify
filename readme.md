# Expensify - WIP

This is a work in progress... User can add an Expense description, amount, date with optional note. These expenses show in a list on the dashboard. This list can be filtered by date or amount. An individual expense can be removed. 

This is a code along from [Andrew Mead](https://mead.io/)'s [The Complete React Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/). I accessed the course through Packt, so the course is not updated.

React 16 
Redux 
Webpack with babel-preprocessor

Datepicker (React-dates) and moment for the date
normalize.css, note.sass, sass-loader for styling

In your terminal:
```
 yarn run dev-server
```
