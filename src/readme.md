This is part of [Andrew Mead]()'s The Complete React Web Developer Course. Acessed through Packt, so not updated.

I am brushing up on using functional components since it's been a while since I've done much react.

The last section is writing your own Sass, which is the first time I've done that. I'm using the same version he did, just so I don't get conflicts. There were compilation erros, had to upgrade node-sass to 4.12.
